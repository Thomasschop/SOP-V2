This GitHub repository shows the code of group 44. 
This code includes an Arduino file to read the analog air flow sensor named 'code_air_flow_analog.ino'.
A Matlab file that will convert the measurements made by the Arduino to a .txt file. This MatLab script is called 'Arduino_to_text.m'. 
Lastly a MatLab file that can convert the .txt file to a plot. It will plot the air flow rate against time. This file is called 'txt_to_plot.m'.
